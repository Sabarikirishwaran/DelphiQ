## 📌 Phase 3 Criteria Mapping

| Criterion                                      | Implementation / Files                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Simulation Execution & Results**          | - *QITE…ipynb*: simulated QITE on the phenanthrene‑quinone fragment. <br> - *React/Stability…ipynb* + *plots static.ipynb*: computed HOMO–LUMO gaps, Fukui functions, reactivity trends, energy diagrams. |
| **2. Reproducibility & Traceability**         | All notebooks are annotated with: <br> – Quantum circuit diagrams, Hamiltonian encodings (JW mapping), <br> – QITE parameters (`dt`, `max_cycles`, convergence), <br> – Design rationales (error mitigation, active-space selection). |
| **3. Quantum Advantage & Benchmarking**       | - *Phenanthrene…ipynb*: includes classical DFT comparisons (HOMO–LUMO, Fukui). <br> - *QITE…ipynb*: shows correlation energy improvements vs HF, discusses active-space relevance. |
| **4. Execution Environment & Challenges**     | • Qubits: shown via `2 × n_active_orbitals` <br> • Circuit depth & convergence: logged iteration behavior in QITE notebook <br> • Simulator used: Tangelo statevector backend <br> • Runtime stats and parameter settings embedded in notebook comments. |
| **5. Industrial Relevance & Future Directions** | Detailed discussion in *Phenanthrene Reactivity…ipynb* and *plots static.ipynb* and our Phase 3 Proposal and *Maths formalism.pdf*, linking carbonyl formation data to asphalt-aging mechanisms, binder design, and future modeling pathways. |
